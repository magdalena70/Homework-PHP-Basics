<!-- Write a PHP program that reads a text from a textarea and several settings and modifies the text
according to these settings. You will receive 3 fields – minimum font size, maximum font size and step.
Each text character should be printed in <span></span> tags.
The first character starts with the minimum font size, printed as a style in the span tag in format:
<span style="[fontSize];">[character]</span>
Each consecutive character should be printed the same way. If the character is a letter,
the font size for the next character should increment by the step until it reaches or passes over the maximum font size.
Then it should start decrementing by the step until it reaches its minimum font size.
Then it should start increasing again, and so on.
For example, if minFontSize=4, maxFontSize=8 and step=3, the font size will change as follows: 4, 7, 10, 7, 4, 7, 10, 7, …
Each character, whose ASCII value is an even number should be stroke using the style "text-decoration:line-through;".
If the ASCII value of the character is odd, this style should be omitted.
Input
The input will be read from an HTTP GET request. The text will be received from a textarea named 'text'.
The minimum font size will be received from a text field 'minFontSize'.
The maximum font size will be received from a text field 'maxFontSize'. The step will be received from a text field 'step'.
Output
Each character should be printed in its own <span></span> tags.
Ensure you escape the characters in the output using htmlspecialchars(). -->
