<!-- You are given an HTML code, written in the old non-semantic style using tags like
<div id="header">, <div class="section">, etc. Your task is to write a PHP script
that converts this HTML to semantic HTML by changing tags like <div id="header">
to their semantic equivalent like <header>.
The non-semantic tags that should be converted are always <div>s and have either id
or class with one of the following values: "main", "header", "nav", "article", "section", "aside" or "footer".
Their corresponding closing tags are always followed by comment like <!-- header --> <!-- nav -->
<!-- etc. staying at the same line, after the tag.
Input
The input will be read from an HTTP GET request holding a parameter named html. See the examples below.
Output
The output is the semantic-version of the input HTML. In all converted tags should make multiple spaces
(like <header      style="color:red">) single and remove excessive spaces at the end (like <footer      >).-->
