<!-- Write a PHP program that reads several unformatted Facebook posts from a textarea
 and converts them into formatted Facebook posts. All posts will be in the format
 [author];[ddmmyy];[post];[likesCount];[comment1/comment 2]. Note that the comments part is optional.
 Each comment wil be seperated by slash "/". If they are no comments, this part will be empty.
 The data should be extracted and put in HTML tags in the following format:
<article>
<header><span>[author]</span><time>[date]</time></header>
<main><p>[post]</p></main>
<footer><div class="likes">[likesCount] people like this</div>
// the div below is optional
<div class="comments"><p>[Comment1]</p><p>[Comment2]</p></div>
</footer>
</article>
date denotes the date, displayed as English word for the month and number with no leading zeroes for the day
(e.g. input date 02-09-2014 becomes "2 September 2014"). For example, we are given the following post:
Pesho Meshev ;02-09-2014;    Sometimes I post very deep messeges on facebook that have nothing to do
with who I am or what I do, but I like people to think that I am very, very deep.    ;160; Such a confession...
/hahaha this is so NOT funny
The colored parts denote the necessary information. Any unnecessary whitespace on the left or right should be removed.
 The result is:
<article>
<header><span>Pesho Meshev</span><time>2 September 2014</time></header>
<main><p>Sometimes I post very deep messeges on facebook that have nothing to do with who I am or what I do,
but I like people to think that I am very, very deep.</p></main>
<footer><div class="likes">160 people like this</div><div class="comments"><p>Such a confession...</p>
<p>hahaha this is so NOT funny</p></div></footer>
</article>
If there are no comments, the respective part should be omitted. If there are multiple posts,
they should be sorted by date (from most recent to oldest). -->
